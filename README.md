Typing Game Project

Objective
The primary objective of the Typing Game project was to create an engaging and user-friendly typing speed test application. Throughout the development process, I aimed to achieve the following goals:
- User Interface (UI) Design: Designing an intuitive and visually appealing interface for the typing game, focusing on elements like timers, progress bars, and dynamic score displays.
-Front-End Development: Implementing the front-end of the game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring responsiveness and compatibility across different browsers.
- Typing Logic: Developing the core logic for the typing game, including recognizing user input, validating correctness, and calculating typing speed and accuracy.
- Keyboard Event Handling: Learning to handle keyboard events in JavaScript to capture user input in real-time and provide immediate feedback.
- Data Structures: Using data structures such as arrays or objects to manage word lists, user profiles, and game statistics efficiently.

Learnings:
Developing typing game project provided valuable insights into UI design, front-end development, and real-time data processing. I gained experience in handling keyboard events, implementing typing logic, and managing game statistics using data structures.

Difficulties:
Encountering challenges in UI/UX consistency, optimizing performance, and debugging complex interactions tested my problem-solving skills. Balancing functionality with performance and ensuring a smooth user experience were key focuses throughout the development process.
